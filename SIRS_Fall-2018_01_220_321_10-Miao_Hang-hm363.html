<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He tried his best to explain well every detail about the knowledge we learn.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q> Very organzied with material</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The subject material. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>the small classroom made it easier to concentrate</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked learning about macroeconomic concepts more in depth.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He simplifies many hard concept </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I loved the structure of this course (mainly the quizes). The quizes prepared you directly for the midterm and final. The quizzes were long analytical problems.but they force you to keep up with the material. They don&#039;t ask you to recall any memorizable information, but instead ask you to display a conceptual understanding of a certain topic.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how the professor explained everything we did excellently and in depth. He was always helpful if there was any question after class or in office hours.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>How the grading scheme was broken up </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor was very intelligent and had a good knowledge about the subject</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked intro to macroeconomics and liked how intermediate was a little more in depth in terms of where everything comes from </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked the pace of this course, we did not stick to the syllabus </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor would always like to help with the explanations of confusing material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Miao is willing to help students and I respect his passion for teaching. He is one of the best economics professor I&#039;ve ever had.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I enjoyed the kindness of the professor and his willingness to help students the most. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I would add more real examples to the class and make students understand better. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>More group disscusion </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>nothing </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would dedicate more time in class to go over the data project. There were workshops that students could go to to learn how to use Python, but the time could be inconvenient for students who have other obligations. Also, the project could also be graded as optional and extra credit instead. The instructions for guiding us how to do the data project were also unclear.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Make the class interesting</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would not do anything differently. I thought Sung Lee would take the cake as my favorite graduate school instructor, but Professor Hang Miao has went above and beyond and is by far the best graduate school instructor I have ever had.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would spend more time on some of the harder topics such as zero lower bounds. I feel like some easier topics were explained more and the harder ones were breezed over.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Eliminate the data project </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would write more clearly and be little more organized in teaching the materials. Also be more specific and point out the highlights of the material. Sometimes the way materials are explained makes students get more confused.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>i would write on the board in a more flowing form rather than all around to its easier to follow </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would explain things a little more in depth</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The data project is confusing and was assigned very close to the final which made it frustrating to work on it and study. I would take it out of the course. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would keep it more organized to know exactly what I wanted to say.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would write on the online note so that students can read easily.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would potentially consider organizing notes on the board more clearly, as sometimes organization was difficult to follow. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He gives us the whole idea of how we get different functions. The clear process make us have a better idea of how everything comes.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>assigning alot of quizzes involved me looking at other material to get a general idea of how to go about the problem </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He encouraged me to follow economic news and see how things like monetary and fiscal policy are affecting us today.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>NA</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Hang Miao on multiple occasions spent up to 6 hours (really actually 6 hours) on his Friday night going over relevant course topics and discussing the economy from a macroeconomic perspective. He has gone above and beyond to prepare me for the real world with technical skillsets, as I now have a concrete understanding of how to use python to fetch and aggregate data. I never thought I could learn so many different things in one course, but Professor Hang Miao seems to have all bases covered. He will do whatever it takes to help any student that seeks help, even if it means sacrificing a lot more of his time than he was planning. He constantly holds extra extended office hours (often twice a week for literally 4 hours of the day). Seeing his dedication made me feel honored to be in his classroom, and I gained an enormous respect for the stressful life of a graduate student of economics.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has encouraged me to learn basic python that will definitely be useful in the future.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Encouraged my interest in learning further about macro economic policy</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It has given me more knowledge in the area of economics </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I plan on going into the field of economics, and meeting with the professor helped me further solidify my choice.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>His supportive attitude and economic intuition encouraged me to study the subject further.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has helped me understand coding in a way I did not before. He also took the time to really sit with me and teach me concepts when I needed help, and did not hesitate to go over them how many ever times I needed. 

</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I don&#039;t wish to be rude, but this professor doesn&#039;t have a strong grasp on the English language. Understanding the concepts is already a challenge, I shouldn&#039;t have to struggle to understand the literal words he says. He bounces all over the place on the chalk board which is confusing. He fails to make clear the broad overviews of what we are learning and how the concepts fit together. I really do not wish to be rude, but the class would move a lot more smoothly if he were more articulate. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>n/a</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The way the first half of the course was taught was rather disorganized. The diagrams that were drawn on the board were difficult to read. The instructor also could&#039;ve explained the concepts more clearly and made it more complicated than it needed to be.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>NA</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I think this professor deserves an award for his teaching. Never have I had a teacher that actually cares so much about how every student is doing, even though he has a busier life than I could imagine.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Despite some comments on rate my professor, this professor is easy to understand and is a hidden gem. He has very good English and a firm grasp of economics. Very smart professor. He is not only a good person, but one of the most genuine and good people I have met at my time in rutgers. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The material was interesting, but after the first mid-term I found the material hard to keep up with. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Thank you Professor Miao. I hope you keep teaching at Rutgers University and we are fortunate to have you in our school.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>A few people were consistently rude to him in class because he&#039;s soft spoken, but he was always kind in return and did not let it affect his teaching style. He was very committed to teaching us, and it did not go unappreciated. I would maybe suggest that this professor should use a mic set in class to help everyone hear him clearly! </q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
